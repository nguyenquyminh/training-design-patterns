Imagine this is a coffee shop, and you can serve just simple coffee, or coffee with other ingredients (milk, sugar or both milk and sugar).
The current design is not good, it is a class explosion. Because what if you add more ingredients for the coffee.
And what if the cost is changed for one ingredient (e.g. milk)? The maintain will be tiresome.

Task:
- Use decorator pattern to solve the problem.
- Hint: For the coffee shop, the coffee is the base class, and the ingredients are the decorators.
