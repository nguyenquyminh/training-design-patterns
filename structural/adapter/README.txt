The current music player can only play .mp3 file.
The MP3 player class has a method playMusic(String fileName) that assumes all files are MP3s.
Newer audio formats like WAV and OGG have their own playback methods and settings, incompatible with the current system.

Task:
- I have created for you 2 new classes: WavPlayer and OggPlayer. DO NOT alter these classes.
- Apply Adapter pattern so that the MusicPlayer can also play WAV and OGG files.
